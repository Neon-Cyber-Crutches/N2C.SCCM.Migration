## Collection Migration use case

Let's say you need to migrate `User` and `Device` collections from `Old_SCCM` to `New_SCCM`.

First import `N2C.SCCM.Migration` module at `Old_SCCM` instance.

```Powershell
Import-Module N2C.SCCM.Migration
```

Then at `Old_SCCM` you could export all your collections metadata which will be used to recreate collections at `New_SCCM` like so:

```Powershell
Export-CMCollectionsMetadata -SiteCode 'ABC' -ProviderMachineName 'sccm_server.domain.com' -Path 'C:\collections_export_file.clixml'
```

Next, using `collections_export_file.clixml` file at `New_SCCM` you could recreate collections like so:

```Powershell
Import-CMCollectionsFromMetadata -Path 'C:\collections_export_file.clixml' -SiteCode 'ABC' -ProviderMachineName 'sccm_server.domain.com'
```
